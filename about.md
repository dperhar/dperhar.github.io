I spent a year trying to become a solo builder. Built 4 products. Abandoned all of them.

Turns out I'm not a builder – I'm the guy who helps builders see what they can't see.

Now running GTM experiments with founders who have products but can't figure out how to get them in front of people.

**FVE (Founder Voice Engine)** – rewrites AI text to match your actual voice, so you actually hit send on outreach.

**Looking for collaborators** – if you've built something and you're stuck at 0→1, let's figure it out together.
