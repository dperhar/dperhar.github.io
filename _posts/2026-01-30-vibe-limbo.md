I love tech. Loved it since childhood – for the ability to make impossible possible.

Games as a kid – HoMM 3, AoE 3, numerous fantasy worlds I've discovered thanks to programs. 
Social networks as a teenager, making me fluent in discourses no one around me even knew about. 
Productivity tools by graduation, love/hate relationships with excel. 
I loved my IT manager job – the velocity one can never achieve in, lets say, oil industry. The creativity, the feeling that you could actually shape how things work, design someone's experience to be cool, even for a minute he is in your app.

But there was always a ceiling. 
Ideas I couldn't get approved with top management. People I couldn't rally to join my own startups. Investors I couldn't convince. The amount of bullshit performance required just to get anything moving – mate, it's so exhausting. I always wanted to just move when it clicks.

Then vibe coding happened.

The permission shock was real. 
Suddenly someone like me – decent at product thinking but eyes glaze over reading code – could actually build things. 
GPT 3 helping with business modeling. 
Gemini 2.5 writing working code and actually becoming a thinking partner. 
Cursor and Claude 4 Sonnet turning ideas into actual software. And I didn't need anyone for this!!

For someone with my "fuck the system" streak, this was everything. No more begging for budget. No more convincing committees. No more waiting for permission. I could just build.

So I did.

## First product.

It was a lab, to see what llms are really capable of. I decided to automate some of my work – auto follow-up sequences for outbound emails. Simple tech, real demand if marketed properly.

Built it. Enabled in my workspace. Bragged "I built a SaaS in 2 days" in my socials. Walked away.

Told myself: too boring. I wanted to invent something that mattered.

---

## Second product.

This time I wanted to do some real hacking – and finally, something worthy came upon my attention. A tool to generate Telegram comments drafts based on my digital twin persona. Making auto-commenting authetic. Being cheaper and less intrusive than ads. Being a real thing, both useful and easy to productize. Called it Karma App, for means of getting what I deserve and as an ode to those too obsessive with their social points.

And I started grinding. 
One month of obsessive work – moving fast and breaking things, my sleep and gym routine included. But I didn't care, since frontend worked, backend was mostly there. Close to shipping.

But then I realized – if Durov woke up wrong, users could lose their accounts. I've built the product on Telegram's gray zone using Telethon. Not to mention that Telegram comments will become a dead internet expo, if the tool goes viral.

Told myself: too risky, I can't sell a service possibly banning users accounts. 
Stopped.

## Third product.

The dream. Canvas-based environment for founders managing AI agents swarms. Build fast, find PMF, stay in flow. Pure focus. A tool for solo builders, who I respect and feel sympathy about. A weapon, making one ship into demand at superhuman speed.

This one I couldn't build alone – it required some real tech heavy-lifting. 
Found a cofounder. Built a deck. Quit a job to undergo a couple of accelerators. It turned out no one is getting funded now pre-sales, even with a PoC. I needed money to build a product, which meant proving demand, which meant building a product I was raising money for. :)

And as it was a category-creating software – I had hard time finding customers. 
LinkedIn outreach felt gross. Didn't have a network. Kept waiting for someone to post asking for exactly what I was building.

Nobody did. 
Paused it.

---

## Fourth attempt.

Full bootstrap mode. Microproduct: get traction, fund bigger things later.

Two ideas: FVE and Signal Finder, both solving my own solobuilders problems.

**FVE – Founder Voice Engine.** 
This one I built because I wanted to automate outreach, while finding the first users.
And you know – one will ask AI to write outreach message, and shit sounds like HR wrote it, so you won't hit send. FVE rewrites AI text to match your actual voice – your rhythm, your slang, your punctuation. So you don't lose this momentum, editing AI generated slop and actually send the message.

I built it. 
It works. 
I still don't know how to find the people who need it. 
[97.4% of Product Hunt launches never hit $1k MRR](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mnc3nu/i_analyzed_500_product_hunt_saas_launches_487_are/) – not because products are bad, but because founders get stuck at exactly this point. I'm one of them.

**Signal Finder.** 
The problem: how do you validate demand for something nobody's searching for yet? New categories don't have keywords. Nobody googled "AI chatbot" before ChatGPT existed. 
Signal Finder was supposed to find the conversations that indicate demand before the category has a name.

I never built it.
Couldn't figure out how to validate a tool that validates demand. The paradox stopped me cold – and all the success cases I red – they were either relying on a kickstart network or on twitter algos. 
Didn't figure out the hack, so I didn't start.

---

Four products. 
Different ideas, different excuses. 
Same ending.

For a while I thought the pattern was fear. Fear of rejection, fear of sales, fear of putting myself out there.

But that didn't quite fit. I've done B2B sales for years. Had numerous fundraising pitches along the way, so whats the problem?

Then it clicked.

**The pattern wasn't fear. The pattern was me trying to be something I'm not.**

Every job I actually loved, I wasn't the builder. 
I was the guy working with someone else's thing – seeing what they couldn't see, helping them aim and cut out the crap, being the strategic mirror, asking strong questions, enabling the one who is building with "Aha!". 
Building was never my part. 

Vibe coding gave me permission to try being a solo builder. My anarchist streak loved the idea – no gatekeepers, no permission needed, just make things.

But permission isn't the same as fit. I tried four times. I'm not a builder.

[More than 35% of startups are solo-founded now](https://carta.com/data/founder-ownership/). Vibe coding made that possible. 
But I wonder how many are like me – people who can build now, but probably shouldn't be building alone. Forcing a solo founder shape because the tools finally allow it, and because "fuck them, they don't get to make it proper".

---

## So here's where I am.

Done pretending. Not starting product five.

What I'm actually good at: enabling builders on the part they can't see clearly. Unveiling the GTM fog. The "I built it, now what" paralysis. That's where I can help.

**FVE exists and works.** If you're someone who freezes at outreach because AI text sounds wrong – it might be what you need. Reach out.

**Signal Finder stays unsolved.** If you're trying to validate something that doesn't fit existing search patterns – I'd genuinely like to hear how you're thinking about it.

And if you've built something real and you're stuck figuring out how to get it in front of people – I'm looking for a few founders to run GTM experiments with. 
Not selling a service. Looking for collaborators. 
Real products, real stakes, figuring out what actually works, together.

Still in vibe limbo. But at least honest about what I am and what I'm not.

If any of this sounds like you, DM me what you're working on.
